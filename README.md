# Note Taker

## Description

This project was created to make a seemless note taking experience right from your personal computer. I was tired of running out of notebook pages and pencil lead. With this application I can take notes easily and save them to the server to come back to at a later date. With this project I got more experience with back end/server site site structure and got a little more familiar with the web host heroku.
